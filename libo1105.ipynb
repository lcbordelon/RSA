    "RSA is a public key encryption method that was discovered by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) in 1982. RSA is also the  basis for encryption that is used over the Internet. The basis of RSA is that it is very hard to factor very large numbers. RSA makes it easy to encode and decode messages using very large numbers if the user has the public and private key. \n",
    "In this project, I'll walk you through the building blocks of RSA and how they come together to encrypt and decrypt messages. I'll also share comments on which parts of the project were difficult, which parts were a little more fun, and which aspects of RSA I would like to continue mastering.\n",
    "Overall, I learned a substantial amount from completing this project.This project pushed me to my limit and really forced me to keep pushing even when I thought I didn't know how else to solve the problems.  "

It really forced me to articulate what I thought the function was doing, even if I was lost. \n",

It forced me to think about which step each function needed to accomplish and the steps required within each function.

    "RSA needs to use Fast Modular Exponentiation (FME) instead of the Python Mod function(%) because of the size of integers that are involved in RSA. The Python Mod function % functions well until the base exceeds nine digits and the power exceeds seven digits. The reasoning behind this is that with the Python Mod function %, the function is attempting to process the modular arithmetic all at once and this takes a very long time (much like how it would take my brain forever to calculate the answer). In contrast, FME is using binary conversion to only calculate the mod for numbers that are factors of the number. This drastically reduces the amount of processing the function has to do and decreases the size of integers the function has to process. See notes in code for more information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I run the Python Mod function % for (1568160359)^20000446 mod 645, my computer will process for hours. The process will take so long that I'll end up terminating the process and moving on to using FME. However, if I use FME for the same equation, I receive the answer (31) in about two seconds. \n",
